Finally, after almost two weeks of going back and forth between designing and coding I can safelly say that I am almost done with my own personal website. I really had a lot of fun learning hmtl, css and javascript. Keep in mind that this is my "real" first website that I started from scracth with only text editor and browser. Therefore, there might be missing things, bugs and issues here and there.

I chose github for my hosting because of one thing. It is FREE. Github also comes with jekyll server as a plus. Since this website is built on top of jekyll, I do not have to worry again about server related issues as github automatically builds the site for me. Hosting on github also means another thing. All the codes I have written for this website is open for all. Anyone can fork, download and modify the codes as they like.
